ACT 1: THE BRIEFING

One late evening, you arrive at an office at the top floor of a high rise residential building.
The police approached you.

                    POLICE OFFICER
            """ Good evening sir! We have a hostage situation happening outside of this room. A man is holding his
            girlfriend at gunpoint. We already have the snipers in position. However, we can't risk shooting the man.
            If we miss, the girl can get shot.
            """

                    NEGOTIATOR (YOU)
            """ Why would he do that? What are his motives?
            """

                    POLICE OFFICER
            """ We ask their neighbors and friends sir. All them says that the man loves the girl. But the girl is
            not exactly faithful. She had countless affairs in the past but the man always seems to forgive. However,
            tonight, the man once again caught her cheating with another man. Perhaps, that was the last straw that
            finally broke the camel's back.
            """

                    NEGOTIATOR (YOU)
            """ I see. Where is this other man whom you say the girl cheats with?
            """

                    POLICE OFFICER
            """ He is dead sir. The man shot him on the spot.
            """

                    NEGOTIATOR (YOU)
            """ Any other casualties?
            """

                    POLICE OFFICER
            """ Well sir, he has also already killed two of our responding policemen. He also killed two
            civilians and wounded one. That wounded one is currently outside where the hostage is happening.
            It's a teenage boy. He needs urgent medical attention, but it is too dangerous to approach.
            """

                    NEGOTIATOR (YOU)
            """ That's unfortunate. It seems the man is really twisted right now.
            """

                    POLICE OFFICER
            """ I agree sir. But we still need to save the girl at all cost.
            """

                    NEGOTIATOR (YOU)
            """ I know. Do you have their names?
            """

                    POLICE OFFICER
            """ Yes sir, the man's name is Berthold, and the girl's is Annie.
            """

                    NEGOTIATOR (YOU)
            """ That is all I need. Thank you.
            """
