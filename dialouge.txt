ACT 1: THE BRIEFING

One late evening, you arrive at an office at the top floor of a high rise residential building.
The police approached you.

                    POLICE OFFICER
            """ Good evening sir! We have a hostage situation happening at the outdoor lounge at the rooftop of
            this building. A man is holding his girlfriend at gunpoint. We already have the snipers in position.
            However, we can't risk shooting the man. If we miss, the girl can get shot.
